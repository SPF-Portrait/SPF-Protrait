## ðŸ“– Abstract 
Fine-tuning a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model on a tailored portrait dataset is the mainstream method for text-to-portrait customization.
However, existing methods often severely impact the original modelâ€™s behavior (e.g., changes in ID, layout, etc.) while customizing portrait attributes.
To address this issue, we propose SPF-Portrait, a pioneering work to purely understand customized target semantics and minimize disruption to the original model.
In our SPF-Portrait, we design a dual-path contrastive learning pipeline, which introduces the original model as a behavioral alignment reference for the conventional fine-tuning path.
During the contrastive learning, we propose a novel Semantic-Aware Fine Control Map that indicates the intensity of response regions of the target semantics, to spatially guide the alignment process between the contrastive paths.
It adaptively balances the behavioral alignment across different regions and the responsiveness of the target semantics.
Furthermore, we propose a novel response enhancement mechanism to reinforce the presentation of target semantics, while mitigating representation discrepancy inherent in direct cross-modal supervision.
Through the above strategies, we achieve incremental learning of customized target semantics for pure text-to-portrait customization.
Extensive experiments show that SPF-Portrait achieves state-of-the-art performance.
